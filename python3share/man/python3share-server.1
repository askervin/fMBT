.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpython3share\-server\fR launches a Python process that enables
executing arbitrary Python code in local namespaces (\fINS\fR) or in
connected \fBpython3share-server\fR processes, if their namespaces have
been imported or exported (\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-I\fR) to this process.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print help, then exit.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR=\fIPORT\fR
listen to connections to \fIPORT\fR (the default port is 8089).
If \fIPORT\fR is "stdin", python3share-server communicates with
client through standard input and output.
.TP
\fB\-\-interface\fR=\fIADDRESS\fR
listen to connections to \fIPORT\fR at \fIADDRESS\fR. If \fIADDRESS\fR
is "all", \fBpython3share-server\fR listens to connections to
\fIPORT\fR on any network address. The default is 127.0.0.1, that is,
only local connections to \fIPORT\fR are accepted.
.SH EXAMPLES
\fBpython3share-server \-\-password=md5:06c219e5bc8378f3a8a3f83b4b7e4649 \\
        \-n mylocal \\
        \-i "from mylibrary import *" \\
        -d\fR

.fi
launches the server in debug mode: does not fork a daemon, logs to
standard output. Clients connecting to this server must authenticate
with password "mysecret" (see \fBecho -n mysecret | md5sum\fR).  The
server has one namespace: "mylocal". Code block "from mylibrary import
*" will be executed in this namespace before executing any client code
in the namespace can be run. The server process listens to only the
local network interface, because \fB--interface all\fR has not been
given.

\fBpython3share-client \-\-password\-file=mypwd.txt \-C localhost \\
        \-n mylocal \\
        \-c "a=41" \\
        \-e "a+1"\fR

.fi
connects to the server, authenticates with the password in mypwd.txt,
executes code block "a=41" in the \fBmylocal\fR namespace, and finally
evaluates expression "a+1" in the same
namespace. \fBpython3share-client\fR prints return values of evaluated
expressions to standard output.
